Hello World!

Assignment 2

I present 3 open source projects that I found in my search process. One of which is ‘Snowplow’, an ideal example for open source project, well maintained and actively improved. ‘2048’ is actively contributed but not an ideal open source project and could be improved. ‘The elements’ is one open source project that should be seriously worked and groomed to make it successful.

Snowplow

With my interest towards data analysis and database programming, I looked up for software related to analytics on data and came across this repository on github. https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow. This open source project is web-scale analytics platform powered by Hadoop, Hive and Redshift and is under Apache License, Version 2.0. It is developed and maintained by Snowplow Analytics Limited, an UK based company.  More about this open source project can be found on http://snowplowanalytics.com. 

Evidence of developer interest:
There is a dedicated team behind this project and the details of the team can be found on the website above. The team gives support via email and chat and they are proud of their work and passionate in what they do. There are 5 services that they offer with snowplow project namely: Snowplow implementation, web and event analytics, KPI and dashboards, Custom data warehouses and pipelines built using EMR and Redshift, Snowplow Care premium support package. The Snowplow Analytics Cookbook is a part of their documentation, which explains in details all the steps involved in the analysis of data phase of their product.

Evidence of user interest (i.e. do people use it?):
There are enterprise level users that incorporated Snowplow for data analytics and their success stories can be found at http://snowplowanalytics.com/about/ users.html.  This gives an understanding about the users interest and satisfaction with this product.

Appropriateness of documentation:
The contributors to the product frame wonderful documentation. There is wiki on github explaining different sub-systems involved in their architecture and interconnections between them. It also explains step-by-step procedure to set up and use their product. Their website is also a great source of documentation. They also maintain an issue tracker and expected contributions.

Readability and maintainability of the code:
Different subsystems involved in the architecture support different platforms and are written in different languages. I could also find segmentation for readability and easy maintenance of code. JavaScript, Hive, SQL, XML and many technologies are involved in coining this product.

Evidence of other appropriate software engineering practices:
When it comes to software engineering practices, they followed agile development practices and are reflected in the work they have done. Issue tracker is used to keep track of the issues, github for version control, wiki and website for documentation and support. There were test cases when required. They also set up a road map in their documentation that discussed their tasks and what they have achieved in every version of release. The sources to collaborate with them on the project are:
Snowplow Google Group and https://github.com /snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us 

Opportunities to contribute to the project (technical and/or other needs, besides financial)
The link https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Contributing gives us an idea where contributions are expected. Project has ample of opportunity for those who are interested in translations and adapting the product to different cultures. They are also looking for improvement in their documentation. I could not find much in the development aspect in the current project.

2048

I spent a lot of time playing this game ‘2048’ on my phone. When we were asked to find open source projects for assignment 2, first thing that I searched is for this game and found the following repository, which is under the MIT license. They put it to work on iPhone, android and Windows and the app are available via respective stores for download.
https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048

Evidence of developer interest:
Seems like it is sprout out of  ‘1024’ game that already exists. Mr. Gabriele Cirulli is the major contributor of all the 21 contributors. Their first version was released on May 5th as Version 1.0.0 on iTunes and improvements related to movement and performance were bundled in Version 1.0.2 and released on May 16th.  Most likely it seems to be a one man’s show.

Evidence of user interest (i.e. do people use it?)
This app is on Apple app store and can be found on the below link below. There are good 238 reviews with over all rating of 4+ and seems like people use it. There are many other similar apps that are more popular and available on iTunes. One that is popular is by Ketchapp and made its place on Top charts by app store and is actively releasing new versions with new features.
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805

Appropriateness of documentation:
There is not much documentation or wiki nor there are steps on how to use it or enhance it. There is an issue tracker and small section on contributing about changes that might be accepted and not. 

Readability and maintainability of the code:
This application is written in java script and commented nicely. Their CSS is maintained in a separate file and specific instructions on which CSS file to tinker with are given. The whole code is not more than 300 lines and very much readable if familiar with JavaScript and CSS though there might be room for some refactoring.

Evidence of other appropriate software engineering practices:
There are evidences of agile practices as there is an issue tracker that is being used and active with bugs that are open and already closed. Wiki is set up but there is very meager information on it about the project and can be worked on it. Version control is used via git for this project. But I neither find any trace of TDD happening nor any test cases written explicitly. There are milestones to keep track of what is achieved but there is no explicit lightweight method used for project management or for setting tasks and tracking their completion. The only way to communicate them is by sending a pull request and let them know our interest to work on the project.

Opportunities to contribute to the project (technical and/or other needs, besides financial)
According to their contributing page, they are not looking for bigger enhancements or changes in layouts. They are looking for things below:
Bug fixes
Compatibility improvements
"Under the hood" enhancements
Small changes that don't have an impact on the core gameplay.

But I think this can be extended to higher levels, count number of moves, display number of moves and lot of room for developer documentation.

The elements

This open source project is developed by students from MIT and recently moved their source code to github and made it open source. Found this project in my search for android game applications on Google code. This is an android application, which implements falling ice game, and there is lot of room for development. The kind of contributions includes new features, refactoring, testing, and documentation. From readme.txt in their project source code, this is under Gnu General Public License. Current source code can be found at the link below.  https://github.com/IDKJava/ the-elements. The original page where the code is moved from is https://code.google.com/p/ thelements/

Evidence of developer interest:
According to Google code web page, they are a team of 4 owners, but the github commit history shows 2 active contributors and are looking for people who can help and improve the application, as they are getting busy.  The interest of the developers can be found from their blog spot at the link http://idkjava.blogspot.com . Commit history can be found at the link: https://github.com/IDKJava/the-elements/commits/master

Evidence of user interest (i.e. do people use it?)
This application is still in development phase and is still not released as an app on Google Play Store or Apple App Store for download.  Once developed they would like to see the application as paid on a closed system like Mac or Windows and as a free application on Android.

Appropriateness of documentation:
This project has absolutely ignored the documentation phase of open source. The Wiki pages are not set up yet and the developers want the open source community to participate in writing the documentation for them. 

Readability and maintainability of the code:
This is an android application written in java.  The code is well commented and made use of interfaces and other object oriented programming concepts, but there are code smells and can be refactored for a cleaner code. Separate modules are created for different features involved.

Evidence of other appropriate software engineering practices:
Some of the software engineering practices can be observed from their github account. The issue tracker is set up for the project. They moved from Google code to github for version control. It can get very difficult to work on this project, as they do not have a wiki or any documentation for this project. They have a google group to contact and collaborate with them at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ thelements .

Opportunities to contribute to the project (technical and/or other needs, besides financial):
The main aspect observed is the documentation part for the project. The project also describes some features to be included and contribution for the same is expected. Some of them include refactoring, improvement in the styles of buttons and a feature to erase the existing contents of the board.
