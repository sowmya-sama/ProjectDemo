<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

<p>I present 3 open source projects that I found in my search process. One of which is ‘Snowplow’, an ideal example for open source project, well maintained and actively improved. ‘2048’ is actively contributed but not an ideal open source project and could be improved. ‘The elements’ is one open source project that should be seriously worked and groomed to make it successful.<p>
